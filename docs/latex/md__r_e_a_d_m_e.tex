\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysection{Introduction}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md0}
This software architecture has been developed by \href{https://studentrobotics.org}{\texttt{ Student Robotics}} in R\+OS to simulate a surveillance robot.

The software developed uses a \href{http://wiki.ros.org/smach}{\texttt{ Smach Finite State Machine}} F\+SM and builds an ontology with \href{https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor}{\texttt{ a\+R\+M\+OR}} based on the information obtained from the markers via the \href{https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d5/dae/tutorial_aruco_detection.html}{\texttt{ Ar\+Uco}} library.

The robotic arm of the robot is moved using the \href{https://moveit.ros.org/}{\texttt{ Move\+It}} software framework, while the surveillance action is performed using the \href{http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping}{\texttt{ S\+L\+AM Gmapping}} algortim and the \href{http://wiki.ros.org/move_base}{\texttt{ Move\+Base Navigation}} package.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Software Architecture}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
There are 6 nodes in this software architecture\+:

Here we can see the Component-\/\+Based Software Engineering diagram\+: \hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{State\+Machine node}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
In this node, the state machine and the sub-\/state machine are initialised.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Client\+:

{\ttfamily /\+Battery\+\_\+\+Switch} to active the R\+O\+O\+M\+\_\+E state

{\ttfamily /\+Movement\+\_\+\+Switch} to active the R\+A\+N\+D\+O\+M\+\_\+\+M\+O\+V\+E\+M\+E\+NT state

{\ttfamily /\+Mapping\+\_\+\+Switch} to active the T\+O\+P\+O\+L\+O\+G\+I\+C\+A\+L\+\_\+\+M\+AP state
\item Service\+:

{\ttfamily /\+B\+Level} to communicate the battery level and the need for recharging the battery
\end{DoxyItemize}

There are 4 classes representing the states of the finite state machine. Each state is characterised by the initialisation function {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+init\+\_\+\+\_\+(self)} and the function representing the state execution {\ttfamily execute(self, userdata)}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily class T\+O\+P\+O\+L\+O\+G\+I\+C\+A\+L\+\_\+\+M\+AP(smach.\+State)}\+: Class implementing F\+SM state concerning the topological map.

Within the execute function, a call is made to the server that connects the F\+SM to the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_topological_map}{Topological\+Map}} node and then waits until the map is constructed.

Returns the transition of the F\+SM to be carried out\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily wait}\+: if the map construction isn\textquotesingle{}t finished
\item {\ttfamily map\+\_\+\+OK}\+: when map construction ends
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily class C\+H\+O\+O\+S\+E\+\_\+\+D\+E\+S\+T\+I\+N\+A\+T\+I\+ON(samch.\+State)}\+: Class implementing F\+SM state conserning the choise of the destination.

Within the execute function, a call is made to the function {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_functions_a5fb18ac3019507966ce334e764117002}{Destination()}}} and 1 second is waited.

Returns the transition of the F\+SM to be carried out\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily b\+\_\+low}\+: if the robot needs to be recharged
\item {\ttfamily destination}\+: when the location in which the robot is to move is chosen
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

This is a piece of code that explains how the location in which the robot moves is chosen\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}

\DoxyCodeLine{\# Urgent rooms reachable}
\DoxyCodeLine{Urgent = [Value for Value in Reachable if Value in Urgent]}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# If several rooms are urgent, choose one randomly}
\DoxyCodeLine{if Urgent:}
\DoxyCodeLine{    Target = random.choice(Urgent)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# If no room is urgent, choose a reachable corridor randomly}
\DoxyCodeLine{else:}
\DoxyCodeLine{    Target = [Idx for Idx in Reachable if Idx in Corridors]}
\DoxyCodeLine{    if Target:}
\DoxyCodeLine{        Target = random.choice(Target)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# If no corridor is reachable, randomly choose a reachable location}
\DoxyCodeLine{    else:}
\DoxyCodeLine{        Target = random.choice(Reachable)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{print(f'Choose location \{Target\}')}
\DoxyCodeLine{return Target}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily class R\+A\+N\+D\+O\+M\+\_\+\+M\+O\+V\+E\+M\+NT(smach.\+State)}\+: Class implementing F\+SM state concerning the random movement.

Within the execute function, a call is made to the server connecting the F\+SM to the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_random_movement}{Random\+Movement}} node, and then you wait until the robot arrives at its destination.

Returns the transition of the F\+SM to be carried out\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily b\+\_\+low}\+: if the robot needs to be recharged
\item {\ttfamily move}\+: if the robot can move between the rooms
\item {\ttfamily wait}\+: if the goal isn\textquotesingle{}t reached yet
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily class R\+O\+O\+M\+\_\+E(smach.\+State)}\+: Class implementing F\+SM state concerning the room E.

Within the execute function, a call is made to the server connecting the F\+SM to the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_battery}{Battery}} node, and and then wait until the robot arrives in charging room E and the battery is fully recharged.

Returns the transition of the F\+SM to be carried out\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily move}\+: if the robot can move between the rooms
\item {\ttfamily wait}\+: if the battery isn\textquotesingle{}t full yet
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Running the F\+SM node in the terminal should show similar output

\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{Working Hypothesis and Environment}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}
The scenario involves a survillance robot operating in a 2D indoor environment, without obstacles, made of 4 rooms (R1, R2, R3, R4), with only one door, and 3 corridors (E, C1, C2), with multiple doors.



The behavior of the robot is divided into 2 phases\+:

{\bfseries{Phase 1}}\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The robot starts from the position (-\/6.\+0;11.\+0);
\item The robot through the movement of the camera must detect the markers in the room and gathers information about the environment;
\item The robot constructs the \char`\"{}semantic\char`\"{} map of the environment.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}



{\bfseries{Phase 2}}\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The robot moves around locations following a surveillance policy\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item It must stay mainly in the corridors,
\item If a reachable room has not been visited for a certain period of time, it must visit it ({\itshape urgency});
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The robot moves to a new location and performs a complete scan of the room to visit another location.
\item When the robot\textquotesingle{}s battery is low, the robot goes to position E and waits for the battery to be recharged before starting the patrolling behaviour again.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysection{System Limitations}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}
The main limitation concerns the detection of markers, as the camera does not have a smooth movement and it may happen that even if the marker is seen, its ID is not recognised.

The battery drain is calculated as if each meter travelled by the robot corresponds to a decrease. However, this calculation is made based on the distance between the start and end position, as the crow flies, without taking into account the presence of walls or obstacles, so it does not reflect the real situation.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysection{Possible Improvement}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md11}
One improvement to be made is definitely to make the battery discharging and charging routine more realistic.

In addition, all the parameters relating to the movement of the robot joints should also be adjusted in order to have a more linear and efficient marker detection.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysection{Author}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md12}
